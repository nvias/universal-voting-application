```

#### Step 2: Test Admin Panel Results

   - Statistics cards (voters, votes, questions, participation)
   - Charts for each question/category
   - Detailed results table
   - Export buttons

#### Step 4: Test API Directly

## Data Format

The results API returns data in this format:

  "session_name": "Nase firmy 2025",
  "total_voters": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "question_id": 1,
      "question_text": "MASKA",
      "question_type": "team_selection",
      "teams": {
        "Tym Alpha": {
          "vote_count": 1,
          "average_rating": 0,
          "option_counts": {"Tym Alpha": 1}
        },
        "Tym Beta": {
          "vote_count": 1,
          "average_rating": 0,
          "option_counts": {"Tym Beta": 1}
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No results found"
**Solution**: Make sure votes have been cast in the system
```bash
# Check if votes exist in database
python test_db.py
```

### Issue: "API endpoint not found"
**Solution**: Ensure the server is running and endpoints are registered
```bash
# Test API health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health
```

### Issue: "Charts not displaying"
**Solution**: Make sure Chart.js is loaded properly
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify internet connection for CDN resources

### Issue: "Results show 0 votes but voting worked"
**Solution**: Check database connection and vote counting logic
```bash
# Test vote counting
python test_results.py
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. **Creating Custom Reports**
You can access the raw data via API and create custom reports:
```javascript
fetch('/api/v1/voting/655662/results')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process data for custom reports
    console.log(data);
  });
```

### 2. **Exporting Data**
Multiple export formats available:
- **CSV**: For spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON**: For programmatic processing
- **API**: For real-time integration

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
The results can be refreshed in real-time:
```javascript
// Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
setInterval(() => {
  loadResults();
}, 10000);
```
